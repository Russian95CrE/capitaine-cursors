# Capitaine cursors

This is an x-cursor theme inspired by macOS and based on KDE Breeze.
The source files were made in Inkscape, and the theme was designed to pair well with my icon pack, [La Capitaine](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

This cursor should scale appropriately for any display resolution.
